For getting aws resources details we use python library called boto3

boto3 has versions 1---client{its a low level resource}
                   2---resource(its a high level resource)


we have to add profiles to aws configure
And then we have to import profile for getting aws resources in python script

I used "ce" is a client low level resource to get usage and cost
